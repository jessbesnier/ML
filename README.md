# ML
overview of codes used for ML projects

ML_codes_from_chris_discharge: the most up to date codes from Christian's excersizes with the goal to reproduce discharge levels given an input (code still in progress and not fully working)

ML_codes_from_chris_res_all: working to reproduce reservoir level heights using different ML models and inputs (in progress)

Time_series_tabular_forecasting: working more on identifying specific aspects of the parameterization of the models

autocorrelation_plots...: creates autocorrelation plots with data

giffy: turns images into a gif

plotting_features: plots features and provides visualization for feature importance

res_imputer_code: works to impute missing data and analyze how much missing data there is
